# Schema First Design 

1. Define the schema
	- Identify the requirements and structure it to support (understanding it will itterative)
2. Backend Implementation
	- build API
3. Front-End Implementation

### Benefits: 
- allows for backend and frontend work to be done concurrently
	- frontend can use mocks based on schema


**NOTE**: This is assumed to be using Graphql. Not sure how this would apply to REST as the API creation would require a contract or shape inorder to allow for backend and frontend to work on the implementation concurrently

# Open Type Font Features
[](https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/1377321780403113991)


A way to create customization to fonts that offer glyph variation.

This can be achieved in [[CSS]] with the property `font-feature-settings: "arg1", "arg2"`

An Inter specific tool to generate these variations can be found [here](https://rsms.me/inter/lab/?invert-colors=1)

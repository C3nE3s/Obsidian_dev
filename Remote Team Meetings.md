# Remote Team Meetings

[Thread here](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1433815603295371265.html)

### Synopsis: 
- remote work that is completely asynchronous can be great for short focused bursts, but in the long term can lead to loneliness and disconnection
- social connection and serendipitous conversations are important for connection
- once a week, have a meeting that is longer than it needs to be the critical thing
- cancel meetings that dont require discussion
- if async discussion goes beyond a few questions or becomes complex or abstract, call a meeting ASAP

### Synopsis
- High growth startups usually result in lots of room for personal career growth
- The company you select matters more than any other factor
- Understand and shoot for companies that are in high potential markets
- Look to the founders/people to assess if they are well suited. Are they passionate? Are they customer centric?
- Trust: will you be taken care of even if the company under-performs / lands soft?
- Product: Look for data about its current product and its market fit to see if it resonates
